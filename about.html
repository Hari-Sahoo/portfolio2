            <p>
                My name is hari and I'm an introverted person who loves to be alone. When I'm alone, I don't feel the need to constantly be surrounded by people. I'm comfortable in my own company and often find myself contented just to stay in and spend time with my thoughts.
I'm passionate about music and art, and I often find myself spending hours listening to music or drawing. I'm also a big fan of movies, and I love to go to the cinema, or just stay at home and watch something on the television.
I love animals, and I would love to one day own a pet. I have a great respect for animals, and I think they should be treated with kindness and respect.
I'm also an avid reader. I love to curl up with a good book, and I'm always looking for something new to learn. I'm also an aspiring writer, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my writing.
In my free time, I like to go for walks, listen to music, and spend time with friends. Even though I'm an introvert, I still love to get out and have fun and be around people.
Overall, I'm a creative person with a passion for the arts and a respect for animals and people. I'm always looking for new experiences and ways to grow and learn.
